This is a simple script that takes an image file and uses the Python Turtle class to draw the image pixel by pixel. To use the code with your own images, replace the file name in the code that the 
script opens with the path of your desired file. The script also outputs every pixel drawing to a file called out.py, it is overwritten everytime main.py is run. out.py does not require a file path, it 
saves the position and color of every pixel in the original script and draws it.
